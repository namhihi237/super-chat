# Super Chat

## Project Description

This project uses Next.js and tailwind, openai to create an interactive chat system where users can engage in a conversation with an AI model.

## Technical Stack

- **Next.js**: A lightweight framework for static and server-rendered applications built with React. It provides out-of-the-box features such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- **OpenAI**: An AI model developed by OpenAI. This model is capable of generating human-like text based on the input it receives. It's used here to create the chat responses.

## Features

- **Create Conversation**: This feature allows users to start a new conversation with the AI model. The conversation context is maintained throughout, providing a seamless chatting experience.
- **Chat with AI**: Users can input their text queries/questions and receive text responses from the AI model. The AI model generates responses that simulate a human-like conversation.

## How to Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository url>`.
2. Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm install`.
3. Set up the OpenAI API key: Create a `.env` file in the root of your project. Add your API to this file
4. Run the project: In the project directory, you can run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the localhost URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) in your web browser to access the application.
2. Start a new conversation with the AI by clicking the 'Start Conversation' button.
3. Type your message in the input field and press 'Send' or hit 'Enter' to chat with the AI.
